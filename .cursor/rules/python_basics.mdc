## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Flask for web framework
- Pydantic v2 for data validation
- pytest for testing
- Ruff for linting and formatting
- PyYAML for configuration

## Conventions

- Use type hints for function signatures and class attributes
- Prefer Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Use service objects for complex business logic
- Keep Flask routes thin, delegate to services
- Use `pytest` fixtures for test setup
- Follow PEP 8 style guide (enforced by Ruff)
- Use keyword arguments for clarity in function calls
- Prefer pathlib over os.path for file operations
