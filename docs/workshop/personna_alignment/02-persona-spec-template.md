# Persona Specification Template — Workshop Reference

**Status:** Moved to canonical location.

The Persona Specification Template produced during Phase 1 (Task 1.3) of the Persona Alignment Workshop now lives at its permanent home:

**`data/templates/persona-spec-template.md`**

This file is retained as a reference pointer. The canonical version at `data/templates/` is the source of truth for all persona creation and review.
