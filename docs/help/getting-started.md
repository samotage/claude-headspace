# Getting Started

Welcome to Claude Headspace! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is Claude Headspace?

Claude Headspace is a dashboard for tracking Claude Code sessions across multiple projects. It shows you:

- Which projects have active Claude Code sessions
- What state each agent is in (working, waiting for input, idle)
- Quick access to focus on any session's terminal window

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch Claude Code Sessions

Start Claude Code in any of your monitored project directories. The dashboard will automatically detect and display them.

### 2. Open the Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:5050` in your browser to see all your active sessions.

### 3. Understand Agent States

Each agent card shows its current state:

- **Working** (blue) - Claude is actively processing
- **Input Needed** (amber) - Claude is waiting for your response
- **Idle** (gray) - Claude has completed its task

### 4. Focus on a Session

Click the "Headspace" button on any agent card to bring its iTerm window to the foreground.
