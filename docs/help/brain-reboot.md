# Brain Reboot & Progress Summary

Brain Reboot is a context-restoration feature that generates a comprehensive snapshot of a project's current state, combining the waypoint with an LLM-generated progress summary.

## What is a Brain Reboot?

When you return to a project after time away, a brain reboot gives you everything you need to resume:

- **Waypoint** - Your planned path ahead (Next Up, Upcoming, Later, Not Now)
- **Progress Summary** - AI-generated narrative of recent git commits and accomplishments

The combined document can be copied to clipboard or exported to the project filesystem for use in new Claude Code sessions.

## Generating a Brain Reboot

### From the Dashboard

1. Click the **Brain Reboot** button on any project group header
2. A slider pane opens and generates the document automatically
3. Review the content
4. Click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the markdown
5. Click **Export** to write it to the project's `docs/brain_reboot/` directory

### From the Project Show Page

1. Navigate to the project detail page
2. Scroll to the **Brain Reboot** section
3. Click **Generate** or **Regenerate**
4. Click **Export** to save to the filesystem

## Progress Summary

The progress summary is generated by analysing recent git commits using an LLM.

### Generation Scopes

- **time_based** - Analyses commits from a configured time window (default)
- **since_last** - Analyses commits since the last summary was generated
- **last_n** - Analyses the last N commits

### Regenerating

On the project show page, click **Regenerate** under the Progress Summary section. This forces a fresh analysis from git history.

On the brain reboot slider, click **Regenerate Progress Summary** at the bottom of the content.

## Export

Exporting writes files to the project's `docs/brain_reboot/` directory:

- `waypoint.md` - Current waypoint
- `progress_summary.md` - Latest progress summary

Previous versions are automatically archived with timestamps.

## Best Practices

- Generate a brain reboot before starting a new Claude Code session on a stale project
- Copy to clipboard and paste into your initial prompt for context
- Keep waypoints up to date so brain reboots are accurate
- Regenerate progress summaries after significant work to keep them current
